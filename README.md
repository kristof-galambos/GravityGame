# GravityGame
If the yellow ball touches the blue area, you won. If it hits the red walls, you lose. But you can't control the yellow ball,
you can only control the orange one. The orange one repels the yellow ball, so you have to go behind it and gently push it in the right
direction. The trick is to never go too close to the yellow ball!

Just run gravityGame.py. It will automatically pip install pygame if you don't have pygame yet.
